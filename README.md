Studying Advanced SAS Topics

In this repository I am putting my code that I generated practicing advanced SAS techniques including proc sql, SAS macro language, indexes, combining data (vertically & horizontally), using hash objects as a lookup table, formats, arrays, and proc FCMP.

For this course I completed the Advanced SAS course on Udemy, but I created my own small datasets to practice the techniques discussed in these videos. I also completed the SAS Advanced practice questions available on the SAS website, the regular version and performance based version.

To test my knowledge I also did the SAS Advanced Practice exam and the SAS Advanced Performance Based Practice Exam.
